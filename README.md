Gradient-based TD Methods

From Weiwei Zhang (260 684 686)

I evaluated different **gradient-based TD methods** on the classic RL environment **Mountain Car**[1]. Each run started near the bottom of the mountain (_-0.5_) with zero velocity. Three actions [_reverse, coast, forward_] are selected in each interation and the reward is always _-1_. The position and velocity are encoded by using 4 or 8 **tile coding** with 10\*10 tilings.
